# Unsupervised Representation Learning for ECG Analysis

Machine learning algorithms can be trained to automatically detect and classify cardiac abnormalities given a patient's electrocardiogram (ECG).
Recent studies on multivariate time series have shown that the unsupervised pre-training of a model and its subsequent application in a classification task can outperform fully supervised approaches.
Thus we would like to investigate unsupervised pre-training for ECG analysis. In particular, we will examine how human assumptions enhance or limit a model's capability to generalize and how well a model can classify cardiac abnormalities given differently large portions of ECG data.
